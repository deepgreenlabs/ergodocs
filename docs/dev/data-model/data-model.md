# The Data Model

Welcome to the heart of Ergo! This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Ergo's unique data model, based on the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, enhanced with powerful smart contract capabilities. Whether you are a developer, a researcher, or simply curious about what makes Ergo tick, this resource will equip you with the knowledge you need.
